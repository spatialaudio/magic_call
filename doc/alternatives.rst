PyTeX
-----

    We've given TeX a Python callable function interface,
    with the TeX daemon running behind the scenes.
    This is proof of concept, but might already be useful.

PyX
---

    PyX is a Python package for the creation of PostScript, PDF, and SVG files.
    It combines an abstraction of the PostScript drawing model with a TeX/LaTeX
    interface. Complex tasks like 2d and 3d plots in publication-ready quality
    are built out of these primitives.
